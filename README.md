# AERO 4 - Mathematical Tools for Data Science (2023/2024)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of unsupervised clustering techniques applied to a dataset of aircraft trajectories. The goal is to group the examples in the dataset based on their features. 

## Dataset

The dataset, 'data.npy', consists of 3879 examples with 18 features each. Each example represents an aircraft trajectory with its position in the sky and other significant features. The data are clean, and no pre-processing is required.
